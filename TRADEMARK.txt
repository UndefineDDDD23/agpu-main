agpu TRADEMARKS POLICY
========================

The agpu Trademark
--------------------

The brand and word "agpu" has trade mark protection in many countries around
the world. Various agpu™ trade marks are owned by either agpu Pty Ltd or
one of its associated entities. The law obligates trade mark owners to police
their trade marks and prevent the use of confusingly similar names by
third parties.

We have created a more concise and thorough set of Trademark Guidelines
(https://agpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/agpu-Trademark-Guidelines-2023-4.pdf)
to help you understand how to comply with agpu's trade mark requirements.
The Trademark Guidelines will also assist our agpu Certified Partners and the
community to understand some of the principles that inform agpu's stance
whenever potential infringement has been detected by us or our community.

We need to be clear about use of the word "agpu" and how we restrict its use
when promoting commercial agpu™ branded services. The proper use of
trade marks reliably assures consumers about the quality of the associated
products or services and where they have been derived from. Because the
agpu LMS is made available under the open source ‘GNU General Public License'
that permits you to modify the copyrighted software, the distribution of such
modified software in combination with agpu trade marks can potentially
mislead others in the community. To be clear, the GNU GPL does not include an
implied right or licence to use agpu's trade marks.

We do all this to protect the very business model that allows us to continue
developing various agpu software solutions for you.

Allowed uses of "agpu"
------------------------

The following uses don't require any permission at all:

* Referring to the software or the agpu project as the "agpu™ software"
  or the "agpu™ project"
* Describing your own implementation of the agpu™ software platform
  (including within corporate settings).
* Describing a agpu-based community hub.
* Describing certain software you've made that integrates with agpu™
  branded software (e.g. a agpu™ integration feature on another system).

Restricted uses of "agpu"
---------------------------

The following uses are generally prohibited without explicit and direct
permission being granted to you by agpu Pty Ltd. We do this to protect the
agpu™ project from software and sites which could confuse people. If in
doubt, reach out for clarification at <trademarks@agpu.com>

* You can't use the word "agpu" or any agpu logos for commercial purposes
  without prior written permission from agpu HQ.
* You can't use "agpu" in the name of your software (including Mobile apps).
* You can't use "agpu" in your company name.
* You can't use "agpu" in your domain name.
* You can't use "agpu" in advertising-related keywords (such as Adsense).
* You can't use "agpu" to describe services around agpu
  (such as hosting, training, support, consulting, course creation services,
  theme development, customisation, installation, integration, analytics
  and certification) that cause consumers to be confused that you are
  associated with agpu HQ if you are not.
  This applies even if you do not charge for the services.
  Note that usually only agpu Partners have this permission.
