agpu Language Packs

This directory contains the standard packaged agpu language files,
for making the agpu interface appear in different interfaces.

The default language for agpu is the English language, under the
Unicode scheme (UTF8).

To add more languages to agpu, you can either:

 1) use the agpu languages GUI in the interface to fetch
    new languages and install them in your 'dataroot' directory.

 2) download them and unzip the packs in this directory manually


For more information, see the agpu Documentation:
